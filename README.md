**Bouncing Balls Animation**
This project is a JavaScript-based animation that simulates bouncing balls inside a circular boundary. Each time two balls collide, a new ball is created, adding to the dynamic behavior of the animation. The entire project is built using HTML Canvas and pure JavaScript, without relying on any external libraries.

**✨ Features**
Realistic ball movement within a circular boundary.
Collision detection between balls and the circle walls.
Dynamic ball generation: A new ball is added whenever two balls collide.
Interactive and visually appealing simulation, created entirely from scratch.

**📚 Motivation**
The idea for this project came from a YouTube short that showcased an animation of balls bouncing inside a circle, with new balls being created upon collisions. Curious about whether I could achieve the same using pure JavaScript, I took up the challenge and started experimenting. This project was an exciting way to enhance my understanding of collision physics and the Canvas API.

**🚀 How It Works**
Canvas Setup: The circular boundary and balls are rendered on an HTML <canvas> element.
Physics Simulation:
Balls move with a random speed and direction.
Collisions with the circular boundary are detected and handled to reflect the ball.
Collision Handling:
When two balls collide, a new ball is created with random properties (size, direction, speed, and color).
Animation Loop: The animation is continuously updated using requestAnimationFrame.
🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 Canvas for rendering the animation.
JavaScript for logic and interactivity.
